          This series was commissioned to illustrate a designer's collection.
          This collection was inspired by the Formula 1 driver Niki Lauda, his
          world where competition never stopped even in his tumultuous personal
          life, especially when he competed against James Hunt in 1976. A rising
          Formula One star, a good amount of love scandals, a tumultuous
          backstage scene hidden behind the spotlights of the front of the stage
          are all the ingredients explored in this collection. It's also a game
          about gender roles : the man becomes fragile and defeated while the
          woman, strong in her leather jacket, chooses the winning side.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          This was my first group shoot, with several models to direct. It
          involved thinking about how light can make a conversation in the
          silence and stillness of photography. How to show what unites and
          disunites two characters? A play of glances and lights is then
          instated.
        </p>

        <p>
          The atmosphere is dark, heavy, heavy, almost vitiated while the models
          are shining stars with their share of light and shadow captured by the
          photograph.
