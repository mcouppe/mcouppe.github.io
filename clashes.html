          At the dawn of spring 2016, many protests are breaking out all over
          France and especially in Paris. The issue ? The "Loi Travail", a law
          ordered under the government of François Hollande and carried by
          Emmanuel Macron,
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >a law leaving a lot of workers more precarious and deleting several
            workers protections</span
          >
          . Thus, as soon as March 2016, wild demonstrations led by students and
          high-schoolers burst to the Eiffel Tower while
          <span class="spanEffect">
            the Place de la République will become the theatre of many
            gatherings under the label of "Nuit Debout"</span
          >
          .
        </p>
        <img
          src="./D011618-R1-03-4.jpg"

        <p>
          The first processions marching through the streets are similar to so
          many others seen so far in the landscape of French militancy. But as
          time went by, tensions with the police forces and the government are
          growing and a still rare phenomenon start appearing in protests : the
          " <span class="spanEffect">Cortege de Tête</span> ". The protesters
          are no longer here to march passively while the union trucks play pop
          music as it's usual in France. It's therefore a matter of struggle.
          <br />
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >Windows fall down, masks cover faces, smoke rises into the sky and
            city squares are reclaimed by demonstrators as the sun sets.</span
          >
        </p>
        <img
          src="./D011618-R1-02-3.jpg"
          style="width: 100%; height: auto"
          alt="protest march in paris, superimpose of several views of the march with flags and protest signs"
        />
        <p>
          As the months go by, there are at least two protests a week and the
          pace is accelerating. The government and the police forces then
          tighten the noose until the famous "49.3", the passage in force of the
          law in the National Assembly.
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >The people inside the "Cortège de tête" start covering themselves
            in black and the first massive Black Blocks appear in France</span
          >
          . This technique from Germany helps the demonstrators to express their
          anger against capitalism and state power by targeting banks and
          multinationals alongside the protests, while at the same time
          repelling police officers who try to stop the processions even before
          they left, notably with
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >mass arrest missions and an increase in police violent
            actions</span
          >
