        <p>
          During my studies in Photography, my school started a partnership with
          the city where the school was located, Ivry-Sur-Seine. The city was in
          the middle of
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >an intensive change of the urban plan and policy </span
          >. This city used to be the typical french working class
          neighboorhood. A lot of brick houses housing workers and big factories
          in all types of industry.In 2010, the city launched the first
          modernising urban plan for years. A lot of industrials zones had been
          left to dust and even if the city stayed under the power of a
          communist mayor, the inhabitants gained more and more buying power and
          wanted more shops and a better-looking neighbourhood. With this urban
          plan, a lot of well-known buildings were destroyed as the Cité
          Gagarine and many residents had to fled to cheaper places, while new
          people from higher social background moved in. <br />In 2014, when we
          started the project, the gap between financially stables and insecures
          was huge. All those new investments into urban plans came with a kind
          of <span class="spanEffect">poverty hunt</span> and a lot of
          communities were targeted. <br />
          At this time, there was 3 huge Romani and Gypsy campsites on deserted
          fields aside the rails of old freight lines, and a few more of little
          ones around the city. The most important one was called the "Camp
          Truillot" and around 400 people lived there. The press called it
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >"le plus grand bidonville du Val-de-Marne"</span
          >, the biggest slum of the department. <br />
          It's in this campsite I worked for several months, looking for
          <span class="spanEffect">"photographics words"</span> to express as I
          could the hard life the inhabitants were living. I was supported all
          along with a romanian classmate who helped me a lot to communicate
          with the people, to traduce and mostly to be accepted as a
          photographer.

          My first times in Truillot Street were without any camera. We tried to
          see what was going on behind the fences.
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >How can we talk about this people and their hard reality with our
            cameras ?</span
          >
          <br />
          We spent a few weeks talking, sharing, expressing ourselves with the
          residents. We learned to know eachothers. Very soon, we were seem as
          regulars in the camp. Some families welcomed us in their homes for
          hours to talk and share syrup recipes. <br />The news of our repeated
          come and go spread fast, with good and bad aspects. Some residents
          looked us as a threat because a lot of press photographers and
          journalists had worked with the city hall and alt-right to
          <span class="spanEffect">despise them publicly</span> with racial
          slurs among others xenophobics obsenities. So a lot of photographers
          had came here to stole pictures of them, sneaking around the camp and
          questioning the children. This had been a treason for the inhabitants
          and they wanted to protect themselves from this because people started
          to attack the camp at night, setting fires, writing death threats on
          the streets wall. <br />
          With this background, we asked some residents how we could help them
          as photographer. We weren't press photographer, we couldn't change the
          mind of xenophobics but we still wanted to be involved in their
          environment with photography. And some of them started to ask us to
          take photographs of their families.
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >A lot of families didn't have any printed picture of them or of
            their children</span
          >, and almost no one had any recent ones.<br />
          That was our open door to help and be definitively accepted there. We
          organised regulars photoshoot, almost 3 per week, and every week, we
          distributed the pictures we took, edited and printed, ready to be
          framed.
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >A new relationship with photography initiated in Truillot
            Street</span
          >. Soon, the children became creatives about it and we learned them
          how to take good pictures, how to think a photograph as a game.

          For me, it became clear the harder part of the life here was the
          constructions. It was the sore spot of the everyday life. Even if the
          "Camp Truillot" was organised as
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >a proper town with cafés, specifics communities neighbourhood and
            even an High Street</span
          >, the bad weather, the malicious behaviours of the neighbours and the
          police coming regulary to destroy a few houses : the comfort was
          really frail and scarce. The whole camp was built on a mud field so
          even the strongest house had to be restored and rebuilt every month.
          <br />During the winter, we witnessed
          <span class="spanEffect">a dozen of intense floods</span>. Those
          floodings made moving around the camp a perilous adventure, destroying
          a lot of houses. And always, after the floods came the rats. The
          ground, teared apart by the water, was then full of tunnels were the
          animals proliferated, moving the fundations of constructions. The
          major work was to elevate the floor of houses and building complex
          systems of retractables stairs so the rats won't come inside. <br />
          An other issue of such insecure constructions was the isolation from
          <span class="spanEffect">the cold</span>. The only way to make some
          heat inside was by using artisanal stoves releasing
          <span class="spanEffect">a very toxic emission of black smoke</span>.
          And most of all, those stove were increasing the risk of fire during
          night, wich was the nightmare of the parents living with children and
          elderly.The risk was already quite high because of the poor electrical
          system they shared. <br />
          All these issues made me realize the bad housing was their curse. It
          was destroying everything from their souvenirs to their clothe, and
          even their health. Some of the teenagers, going to the city schools
          told us they could never "fit" because of the place they lived. That's
          why I choose to document those frail constructions. To leave a trace
          of what kind of reality children and teenager have to cop with even in
          the XXIst century.
          <br />
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >The "Camp Truillot" had been evacuated by police forces in July
            2015. We stayed with its inhabitants until the last moment. A few of
            them had been deplaced to "social housing", mostly families, but the
            larger part of the people fled to other camp all around the parisian
            suburb.</span
