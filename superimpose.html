          Superimposing is taking several shots on the same quarter of film.
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >This way, you can capture a composition of pictures, lines, colours
            overimpressed on eachothers, creating a new complex frame.
          </span>
          Using superimpose on faces or body shapes allows me to twist their
          shapes. The body becomes a drawing of successives lines I can distord,
          as I can modulate the faces, giving them a
          <span class="spanEffect"> nearly monstrous shape</span>. By capturing
          several shots of the same silhouette or face in movement, I tried to
          transfigure reality, to bring this reality to a
          <span class="spanEffect">more dreamlike dimension</span>.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./2016-04-PANORAMA001.jpg"
          style="width: 100%; height: auto"
          alt="panorama analog picture of streets, railways, buildings, public lights and a christmas tree "
        />
        <p>
          In addition to faces and silhouettes, our environment can also take on
          a new dimension, from garbage cans that turn into trees to station
          rails that pile up on crowded streets.
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >The superimposition spreads like wildfire over the world,</span
          >
          sometimes adding fantasy, sometimes more challenges. Moreover,
          superimposition goes in tandem with the medium, the silver film.
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >The light and the colours are added to the sensitive surface,
            creating a real chemical chain.</span
          >
          Accordingly, the colours, lines and lights that will stand out the
          most depend on two factors: the film formula chosen and the lens used.
          Thus, the Kodak Gold with its less saturated and globally more yellow
          tones will give a warmer but also more distant halo,
          <span class="spanEffect">as frozen in the past</span>. At the
          opposite, the Fujifilm Superia Xtra revives magenta and green and
          offers more contrast: the atmosphere becomes more frightening and
          almost foreshadowing an uncertain future.<span class="spanEffect">
            an uncertain future.</span
          >
        </p>
        <img
          src="./2016-04-PANORAMA002.jpg"
          style="width: 100%; height: auto"
          alt="panorama analog photography of a girl in a café but also streets and people walking inside an art gallery"
        />
        <p>
          For black and white, the line is the most important. Thus, what is
          photographed must be seen as a pattern and the superimposition becomes
          similar to a lithograph. I have been considering the 120 format in
          panorama as a continuity of lines.
          <span class="spanEffect">The gradually overlapping views</span> tell a
          story only by their graphic features. Some elements are recognizable
          and others come to drown in this ocean of black and white to get a
          different appearance. Some views are taken in landscape format and
          others in portrait, also changing the angle of view, thus allowing to
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >leave a reading by view and enter even more in this maze of
            scenes.</span
