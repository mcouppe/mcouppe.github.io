          In this section, you will find various shots taken over the years and
          during my adventures. Whether they are
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >scenes of everyday life or "souvenir photography"</span
          >
          , it is important for me to constantly try to freeze/store colours,
          lights and atmospheres. Thus, from the calm water on the Hastings
          waterfront to this bed edge slightly eroded by time, I am always
          <span class="spanEffect">
            looking for the perfect reproduction of the effect of light on the
            texture</span
          >
          . The building under demolition is slightly yellowed by a setting sun
          filtered by clouds but also by the layer of pollution and dust that
          covers it. It is this combination of added elements that creates this
          aesthetic effect. And it is thanks to the accumulation of these
          physical effects that we arrive at the photograph of the station
          platform where we can perceive the waves of steam due to the heat wave
          on concrete and iron.
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >In this way, photography is no longer just a vehicle for scenes and
            events, but becomes a carrier of an atmosphere that agitates our
            sensory capacities.</span

          These two photographs of overflowing coloured liquid are the result of
          a partnership with Broncolor. Here, a physical phenomenon is frozen by
          the strobe of light. The drops that explode, the liquid that overflows
          from its container are all micro-events that appeal to the senses and
          our ability to perceive matter and its gravity.
        </p>
        <img
          class="insidePhoto"

        />
        <p>
          Finally, I also used light and colour as tools to express emotions.
          The light underlines the features while the colour brings the
          liveliness of the expression: is it a catch on the spot with rosier
          lips and more colourful cheeks or is it a more diffuse feeling,
          causing skin discolouration?
