          This work is the result of a long and important collaboration with one
          of my childhood friend when she was studying to be a fashion designer
          and an other friend of mine who was in make-up art school.
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >We worked together to build a whole universe based on our
            differents esthetics.</span
          >
          I've presented this project as my Final Project for my Higher National
          Diploma in Photography.<br /><br />
          We played a lot with the archetype of the young girl, slightly naive,
          bringing us to
          <span class="spanEffect">the american highschoolgirl fantasy</span> as
          we saw it in tv shows.

          The ultimate purpose of this photoshoot was to highlight everyone
          involved in it. I took each picture asking myself : am I enhancing
          enough the work of the MUA ? Is it perceivable how the model interacts
          with the fabric of the skirt ? It has been an excellent exercise
          because
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >I was for the first time managing my own team </span
          >with all the responsabilities coming with it.

          alt="close-up of the model twisting her hair while looking away"
        />
        <p>
          I had to find
          <span class="spanEffect"
            >the proper ways to direct the model and everyone on set
          </span>
          while doing my photographer work with all the technical aspects and
          also follow carefully the guidelines from the designer to respect her
          esthetic and work.
